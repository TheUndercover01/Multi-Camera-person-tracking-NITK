# Multi-Camera Person Tracking and Recognition System for NITK

A sophisticated surveillance system that utilizes multiple cameras to track and recognize individuals, with a specific focus on detecting jaywalking incidents within the NITK campus.

## Features

- Multi-camera person tracking
- Face recognition capabilities
- Real-time jaywalking detection
- Web-based alerting system
- Logging system for incident tracking

## System Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Webcam or IP cameras for video input
- Sufficient computational resources for real-time processing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Multi-Camera-person-tracking-NITK.git
cd Multi-Camera-person-tracking-NITK
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - Flask web application for the alerting module
- `face_recog.py` - Main face recognition implementation
- `face_train.py` - Training script for face recognition
- `tracker_logs.py` - Logging functionality implementation
- `templates/` - Contains HTML templates for the web interface

## Usage

### Training Face Recognition Model

To train the face recognition model with new faces:

```bash
python face_train.py
```

### Running the Face Recognition System

To start the face recognition system:

```bash
python face_recog.py
```

### Running the Alerting Module

The alerting module is a Flask web application that displays detection results and alerts. To run it:

```bash
python app.py
```

The web interface will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`

## Logging

The system maintains two types of logs:
- `jaywalking_log.txt` - Contains detailed information about detected jaywalking incidents
- System logs generated by the tracker for debugging and monitoring
